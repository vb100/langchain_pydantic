# Get LLM output as Python object with Langchain and Pydantic
<p>The Pydantic output parser is a tool that allows users to define a JSON schema to query LLMs for outputs that adhere to that schema. This is pivotal for applications that require structured data, as it ensures outputs conform to predefined formats. The parser leverages Pydantic’s BaseModel for data validation and type checking.</p>

<p>With this tutorial and code in this repo you will learn to: set up the data model in a way that Langchain’s output parser can be used to generate structured data.</p>

<p>In this tutorial I used OpenAI's ChatGPT API to support LLM. Feel free to use any supported LLM using LangChain </p>
